# Kit Prequel

To solve the exercises, you should modify the KP formulation present in the "exercise_\*.py" inside each "exercise_\*/" folder.
When you are done update the model to fit the exercise demands, you can check the correctness of your answer by running the following command:

`python main.py [exercise number]`

For example, let's say you want to check the answer of exercise 1. You can do it by running: 

`python main.py 1`
